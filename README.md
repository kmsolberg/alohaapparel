## Personal Learnings
- Having a well laid-out and planned HTML is essential for having a concise, organized CSS.  I was originally too liberal with my classes and it became very complicated when I had to build in reponsiveness to the site.  I did not originally appreicate that having less code was better.
- Always start with the mobile site, if possible.  It's simpler, and will be easier to put together in the end!
- 95% of the time, if I couldn't figure something out, google had the answer.  In the future, I will make sure to keep better track of where I'm finding my solutions to refer back to at a later point.
- I had to learn to let minor details go until I could solve the larger issues.  I would get stuck on things like "is that orange too dull" instead of more important things.
- Having a to-do list that I could update was also helpful, then I wouldn't get sidetracked by other things.
- Flex-box isn't very intuitive for me, I'm going to be much more careful next time I set up a site to make sure that they're used to their fullest.  I found myself deleting a lot of extra code because I had added in all four possible options because I couldn't find a solution.
